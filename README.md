It is a simple extension board (shield) for Arduino Nano, but connectible also to any other Arduinos. Board contains few RC circuits creating a system of modules representing the 1st and/or 2nd order systems in various configurations. User can control the system from the Arduino using e.g. PID control algorithms and measure the system responses. Combination with Matlab/Simulink is also possible.

Initial design was done by students András Blahó and Filip Brhlík during their diploma projects.
